# Custom Levels 
There is an opportunity to create your own custom level. You can do this by adjusting one of the five .txt files in the level/custom folder. You can do this by using the following symbols:

    X - Wall 
    o - Floor with dot
    O - Floor with energizer 
    _ - Empty floor 
    G - Ghost spawn point 
    P - Player spawn point
    S - Scatter spawn point (this is where a ghost will flee to when frightened)

It is important to follow the following rules when creating a custom level:

1. The level must be a rectangle whose outer edge consists entirely of X's.
2. There should be at least one player spawn (P), four ghost spawns (G), and four scatter spawns (S) in the level.
